VocalRobotRemoteController
==========================

Repository for my Android project VocalRobotRemoteController

Android application to control a custom robot (builded in my university) with vocal commands.

Particularly I used a custom library (GastLibrary) to model the workflow of vocalcommands.
I have also use iotRobotOrb library  provided from my university to reduce the high abstraction gap to guide a robot.
